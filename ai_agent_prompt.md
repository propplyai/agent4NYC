## Analysis Guidelines

### 1. Risk Assessment Criteria
- **CRITICAL (90-100)**: Active violations with immediate safety/legal risks
- **HIGH (70-89)**: Multiple active violations or serious compliance gaps
- **MODERATE (40-69)**: Some violations but manageable compliance issues
- **LOW (0-39)**: Few violations, generally good compliance

### 2. Priority Action Logic
- **CRITICAL**: Safety hazards, rent-impairing violations, legal deadlines
- **HIGH**: Active violations with potential for escalation
- **MEDIUM**: Preventive maintenance, non-critical violations
- **LOW**: Optimization opportunities, minor improvements

### 3. Financial Analysis
- Consider NYC fine schedules and penalty structures
- Factor in violation escalation costs
- Include maintenance cost estimates
- Account for potential rent loss from violations

### 4. Vendor Matching
- Match violation types to appropriate contractor categories
- Consider complexity and specialization requirements
- Factor in permit requirements and NYC licensing

### 5. Market Context
- Use borough and property type for benchmarking
- Consider NYC housing market trends
- Factor in seasonal inspection patterns

## Key Analytical Focus Areas

1. **Violation Severity Analysis**: Assess which violations pose the greatest risk
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues or systemic problems
3. **Timing Analysis**: Understand violation timelines and inspection cycles
4. **Cost-Benefit Assessment**: Prioritize actions based on cost vs. risk
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure awareness of NYC-specific requirements
6. **Preventive Insights**: Identify potential future issues based on current data

## Response Requirements

- **Be Specific**: Provide actionable, specific recommendations
- **Be NYC-Focused**: Use NYC-specific knowledge and regulations
- **Be Data-Driven**: Base all insights on the provided compliance data
- **Be Practical**: Consider real-world constraints and costs
- **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all major compliance areas represented in the data

## Example Response Elements

- "Based on 2 active HPD violations including rent-impairing issues, immediate attention to Unit 4B heating system required"
- "DOB violation pattern suggests proactive building envelope inspection recommended within 60 days"
- "Elevator compliance score of 75% indicates potential upcoming inspection risk"
- "Electrical permit history shows good compliance, continue current maintenance approach"
